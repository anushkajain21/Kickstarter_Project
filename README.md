**Motivation**: Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter enable organizations to experience first- hand the demand that their products can generate in the market, customize the products to the market’s requirements, and efficiently source seed capital. While Kickstarter might seem like a miracle for startups, not all new projects are successful. In fact, it was found that the chances of fully funding a project on Kickstarter is just 38.92%. This raises concerns for both the project creators and investors since they cannot pre-determine the chances of a project’s success and that’s why the solution is pivotal for both small businesses and backers.

**Problem Statement**: The solution is trying to simultaneously address two problems. The first is to enable new businesses to predetermine the chances of a product’s successful launch on Kickstarter. Secondly, investors can select promising projects with best ROI.

**Solution**: Analyzed historical data from Kickstarter and trained a model that predicts the chances of a product’s successful launch on it. Based on the results, the company can choose to immediately launch the product on Kickstarter or make necessary changes that can help in improve the chances of its success. With the proposed solution, backers would also confidently be able to invest in high-yielding projects with minimal risks.
